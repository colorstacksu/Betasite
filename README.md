## Homepage (HeroSection.js)
_In bold is the template for how we need to document information for each webpage_

##### Give a general description of what the page looks like 
##### and its purpose (what does it do who may use it)

This is the first page that appears when the website is opened.
It displays a picture of the current Eboard to the left half of the website and the other half display text that welcomes the user to the website.

##### Describe what any interactive feature (eg. button, dropdown, carousel etc.) is doing or what happens after it is interacted with (eg. click, hover, etc.)

Below the right half with the text, there are 2 buttons:

Button 1 ("Join the National Org."): This is a yellow button with black font for text which when clicked on, sends the user to a new webpage which presents a form to fill to apply to become a member of the Colorstack National Organization
Link: https://app.colorstack.io/apply

Button 2 ("Join Colorstack KSU"): This is also a yellow button with a black font for text which when clicked on, sends the user to a new webpage which is a registration website for students of Kennesaw State University. It specifically takes the user to the URL to register to become a Colorstack KSU member
